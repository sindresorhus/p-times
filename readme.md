# p-times

> Run promise-returning & async functions a specific number of times concurrently

## Install

```
$ npm install p-times
```

## Usage

```js
import pTimes from 'p-times';

const result = await pTimes(5, i => createFixture(`ðŸ¦„-${i + 1}`));

console.log(`Created fixtures: ${result.join(' ')}`);
//=> 'Created fixtures: ðŸ¦„-1 ðŸ¦„-2 ðŸ¦„-3 ðŸ¦„-4 ðŸ¦„-5'
```

## API

### pTimes(count, mapper, options?)

Returns a `Promise` that is fulfilled when all promises returned from `mapper` are fulfilled, or rejects if any of the promises reject. The fulfilled value is an `Array` of the fulfilled values returned from `mapper` in order.

#### count

Type: `number`

Number of times to call `mapper`.

#### mapper(index)

Type: `Function`

Expected to return a `Promise` or value.

#### options

Type: `object`

##### concurrency

Type: `number`\
Default: `Infinity`\
Minimum: `1`

Number of concurrently pending promises returned by `mapper`.

##### stopOnError

Type: `boolean`\
Default: `true`

When set to `false`, instead of stopping when a promise rejects, it will wait for all the promises to settle and then reject with an [aggregated error](https://github.com/sindresorhus/aggregate-error) containing all the errors from the rejected promises.
